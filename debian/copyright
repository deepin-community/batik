License: CC-BY-SA-2.5
 THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS
 PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR
 OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS
 LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.
 .
 BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE
 BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED
 HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.
 .
 1. Definitions
 .
   a. "Collective Work" means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or
      encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along
      with a number of other contributions, constituting separate and
      independent works in themselves, are assembled into a collective whole. A
      work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a
      Derivative Work (as defined below) for the purposes of this License.
   b. "Derivative Work" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work and
      other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical arrangement,
      dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording,
      art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which the
      Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted, except that a work that
      constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work
      for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the
      Work is a musical composition or sound recording, the synchronization of
      the Work in timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be
      considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.
   c. "Licensor" means the individual or entity that offers the Work under the
      terms of this License.
   d. "Original Author" means the individual or entity who created the Work.
   e. "Work" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the terms
      of this License.
   f. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License
      who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to
      the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to
      exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.
   g. "License Elements" means the following high-level license attributes as
      selected by Licensor and indicated in the title of this License:
      Attribution, ShareAlike.
 .
 2. Fair Use Rights.
 .
 Nothing in this license is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any rights
 arising from fair use, first sale or other limitations on the exclusive rights
 of the copyright owner under copyright law or other applicable laws.
 .
 3. License Grant.
 .
 Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants
 You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of
 the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated
 below:
 .
   a. to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collective
      Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collective Works;
   b. to create and reproduce Derivative Works;
   c. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform
      publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission
      the Work including as incorporated in Collective Works;
   d. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform
      publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission
      Derivative Works.
   e. For the avoidance of doubt, where the work is a musical composition:
         i. Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor waives the
            exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a
            performance rights society (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), royalties for
            the public performance or public digital performance (e.g. webcast)
            of the Work.
        ii. Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor waives the
            exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a music
            rights society or designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency),
            royalties for any phonorecord You create from the Work ("cover
            version") and distribute, subject to the compulsory license created
            by 17 USC Section 115 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in
            other jurisdictions).
   f. Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of doubt,
      where the Work is a sound recording, Licensor waives the exclusive right
      to collect, whether individually or via a performance-rights society (e.g.
      SoundExchange), royalties for the public digital performance (e.g.
      webcast) of the Work, subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC
      Section 114 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other
      jurisdictions).
 .
 The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or
 hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications
 as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats.
 All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.
 .
 4. Restrictions.
 .
 The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited
 by the following restrictions:
 .
   a. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
      digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You
      must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this
      License with every copy or phonorecord of the Work You distribute,
      publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may
      not offer or impose any terms on the Work that alter or restrict the terms
      of this License or the recipients' exercise of the rights granted
      hereunder. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all
      notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties.
      You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
      digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that control
      access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this
      License Agreement. The above applies to the Work as incorporated in a
      Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from
      the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You
      create a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the
      extent practicable, remove from the Collective Work any credit as required
      by clause 4(c), as requested. If You create a Derivative Work, upon notice
      from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the
      Derivative Work any credit as required by clause 4(c), as requested.
   b. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
      digitally perform a Derivative Work only under the terms of this License,
      a later version of this License with the same License Elements as this
      License, or a Creative Commons iCommons license that contains the same
      License Elements as this License (e.g. Attribution-ShareAlike 2.5 Japan).
      You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this
      License or other license specified in the previous sentence with every
      copy or phonorecord of each Derivative Work You distribute, publicly
      display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may not
      offer or impose any terms on the Derivative Works that alter or restrict
      the terms of this License or the recipients' exercise of the rights
      granted hereunder, and You must keep intact all notices that refer to
      this License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute,
      publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the
      Derivative Work with any technological measures that control access or
      use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this License
      Agreement. The above applies to the Derivative Work as incorporated in
      a Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart
      from the Derivative Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this
      License.
   c. If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
      digitally perform the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works,
      You must keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide,
      reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the
      Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or (ii) if
      the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties
      (e.g. a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution
      in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable
      means, the name of such party or parties; the title of the Work if
      supplied; to the extent reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource
      Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the
      Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing
      information for the Work; and in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit
      identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., "French
      translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on
      original Work by Original Author"). Such credit may be implemented in any
      reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Derivative
      Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear where any
      other comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as
      prominent as such other comparable authorship credit.
 .
 5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
 .
 UNLESS OTHERWISE AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE
 WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING
 THE MATERIALS, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
 LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
 PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY,
 OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME
 JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH
 EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 .
 6. Limitation on Liability.
 .
 EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE
 LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL,
 PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE
 WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 .
 7. Termination
 .
   a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically
      upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or
      entities who have received Derivative Works or Collective Works from You
      under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated
      provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance
      with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any
      termination of this License.
   b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is
      perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).
      Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the
      Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at
      any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to
      withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required
      to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will
      continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.
 .
 8. Miscellaneous
 .
   a. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or a
      Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the
      Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under
      this License.
   b. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a Derivative Work,
      Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the
      same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this
      License.
   c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
      applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the
      remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by
      the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the
      minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
   d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach
      consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed
      by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
   e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with
      respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,
      agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified
      here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may
      appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified
      without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.
